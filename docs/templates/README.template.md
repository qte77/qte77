# name

> name is what-it-does for who — one-line positioning.

<!-- Hero: H1 + one-line tagline required. A theme-aware wordmark is optional — if used,
     replace the H1 with a <picture> (self-hosted at assets/images/, dark + light). -->

<!-- Badges: License → Version → CI/status (SSOT: paperverse). Static (License, Version) = shields.io blue;
     status badges = native color. Left-aligned, consecutive lines, no <p align="center">. Only sanctioned external images. -->

<!-- Optional screenshots: theme-aware, self-hosted at assets/images/, collapsed, bottom of What.
     Keep the blank lines inside <details>/<picture> so GitHub renders the nested markdown. -->

## How

<!-- One minimal example to get running. Full reference → docs/. -->

```bash
install && run
```

See [docs/quickstart.md](docs/quickstart.md) for full setup.

## Why

<!-- 2–4 lines, deferred here on purpose. Pattern: incumbent pioneered X → gap Y → we differ: Z.
     Link the spec if there is one (docs/PRD.md, docs/UserStory.md). -->
